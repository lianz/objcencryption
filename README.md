# objcencryption
Encryption library implemented in Objective-C. AES, SHA, RSA

This library was intended as an experiment in implementing RSA/AES/SHA encryption algorithms in a Objective-C way. There are lots of crypto libraries around there, but I did not find one that has ja pure Objective-C (or objectoriented) API.
This implementation is based on the OpenJava implementation of BigInteger, and now encryption is very easy to use, especially using the library with NSData or NSString.

Disclaimer: This is not tested against security errors or alike. If you find anything, let me know
